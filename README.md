Blackjack web app
### web-server üíª

This is a big step from the prototype build of the game. This step sees the introduction of the backend and my first step into developing a web server. I will also try to keep the files organized and in a professional manner like I would in a real workplace. This project sees the introduction of new technologies such as:

- express.js  handing server connections
- socket.io   handling web socket 2 way communication
- nodemon     to relaunch the server when the code is updated (dev dependency)
- uuidv4      create unique id's for the room

**Run the project**
1. from the backend directory run the command "npm install"
2. npm run dev
3. on a browser goto localhost:3000

**Heres to not losing interest and actually completing a project! üëç**
