Blackjack web app

This is a prototype and hopefully one day a final product for a full-stack web app I am creating for my portfolio. This project is going to have 3 separate directories that will be the stages of the product and each its own version of the blackjack game.. (unless I decide to add more later..) ü´°

1. prototype
2. web-server
3. blackjack-react

### prototype ü§ñ

This is the first rendition of the project. It is simple in both the front and backend (if there is any). This prototype is to prove that a blackjack game on the web is possible without doing too much research.

### web-server üíª

This is a big step from the prototype build of the game. This step sees the introduction of the backend and my first step into developing a web server. I will also try to keep the files organized and in a professional manner like I would in a real workplace. This project sees the introduction of new technologies such as:

- express.js  handing server connections
- socket.io   handling web socket 2 way communication
- nodemon     to relaunch the server when the code is updated (dev dependency)
- uuidv4      create unique id's for the room

**Run the project**
1. from the backend directory run the command "npm install"
2. npm run dev
3. on a browser goto localhost:3000

### blackjack-react üöÄ

This part of the project will see a much better UI implementation using React for the front-end. Most of the backend should remain the same. The main difference will be the introduction of a much sleeker looking UI

**Heres to not losing interest and actually completing a project! üëç**
